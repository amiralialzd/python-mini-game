# Python Mini Game

Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This is a mini game I created using Python.

### Game Overview:
- The game generates a random number between **0 and 10**.
- The user must guess the number.
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  - **"Too high"** if the guess is above the target number.
  - **"Too low"** if the guess is below the target number.
  - **"You're close!"** if the guess is near the target number.
- When the user guesses the correct number, the game will print the number of tries it took to guess correctly.

### How to Play:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter a guess when prompted.
3. Keep guessing until you get it right! The number of attempts will be shown once you win.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-mini-game.git
